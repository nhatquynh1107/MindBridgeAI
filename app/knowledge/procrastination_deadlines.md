# Procrastination & Deadline Panic

## Why procrastination happens
Often it’s not laziness—it’s:
- fear of failing / perfectionism
- task unclear
- too tired / low mood
- boredom + phone escape

## The “2-minute start” rule
Set a timer for **2 minutes** and do the *first tiny step*:
- open the doc
- write the title
- copy the question
- list 3 bullet ideas
If you stop after 2 minutes, still a win.

## Make it clearer (reduce mental load)
Ask:
- “What does done look like?” (one example)
- “What’s step 1?” (not step 10)

## Anti-perfection script
- “Draft first. Improve later.”
- “A messy start is still a start.”

## Fast focus setup (15 minutes)
- phone out of reach (or airplane mode)
- one tab only
- timer 15 minutes
- reward after (song, snack, 5-min scroll)

## When to get help
If procrastination is constant for months and you feel stuck or numb, talk to someone—ADHD, anxiety, depression, or burnout can be involved.
