# Crisis Support (When It Feels Too Much)

## If you feel unsafe right now
- **Tell someone immediately** (parent/guardian, trusted adult, teacher, neighbor).
- If you are in immediate danger, contact **local emergency services**.

## If you’re having thoughts of self-harm
You deserve support, and you don’t have to handle it alone.
Try this 3-step plan:
1) **Move to a safer place** (near people, away from sharp objects/meds).
2) **Reach out now** to a trusted person: “I’m not okay and I need help staying safe.”
3) **Delay the urge 10 minutes** using grounding (5–4–3–2–1) + slow breathing.

## What to say (simple)
- “I’m scared of what I might do. Please stay with me / help me get help.”
- “I need support tonight.”

## If you can’t reach someone you trust
- Contact a **local crisis hotline** or **medical service** in your country.
- If you’re a student, your school counselor/teacher can help you access support.

## Reminder
Strong feelings can feel permanent, but they change. Getting help is a brave, smart step.
