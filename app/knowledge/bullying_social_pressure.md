# Bullying, Online Drama & Safety

## What counts as bullying
- repeated humiliation, threats, exclusion, spreading rumors
- sharing private photos/messages without permission
- coordinated group attacks online

## Immediate steps
- **Don’t fight alone.** Tell a trusted adult/school staff.
- Save evidence (screenshots, dates, usernames).
- Block/mute/report accounts.
- Avoid replying in anger (it can escalate).

## What to say to an adult
- “This is happening repeatedly and I feel unsafe.”
- “Here are screenshots and dates.”
- “I need help stopping it.”

## Protect yourself online
- tighten privacy settings
- remove unknown followers
- don’t share passwords
- avoid “explain yourself” public threads

## When urgent
If there are threats of violence, stalking, or you feel in danger: seek immediate help from trusted adults and local emergency services.
