# Body Image, Health & Self-Pressure

## Common pressures
- comparison on social media
- comments from friends/family
- perfection standards (“I must look like X”)

## Reality checks
- photos online are often curated/filtered
- bodies change a lot during teen years
- health ≠ a single number

## Health basics (not extreme)
- regular meals + water
- movement you enjoy (walk, dance, sport)
- sleep routine
- self-kind language

## Scripts for comments
- “Please don’t comment on my body.”
- “I’m focusing on being healthy, not perfect.”
- “That joke hurts—stop.”

## When to get help
If you restrict food severely, binge/purge, or feel obsessed with weight/looks—reach out to a trusted adult and a health professional.
