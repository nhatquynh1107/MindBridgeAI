# Conflict With Parents (Rules, Pressure, Trust)

## Common patterns
- parents focus on results; teens want understanding
- shouting replaces listening
- both sides feel disrespected

## Best time to talk
Not during a fight. Choose a calmer time:
- after dinner
- weekend morning
- during a walk

## Conversation framework (works well)
1) “I want a better relationship, not a fight.”
2) “When X happens, I feel Y.”
3) “What I need is…”
4) “Can we try this plan for 1–2 weeks?”

## Scripts
- “I understand you want the best for me. I’m stressed and need a realistic plan.”
- “Can we agree on a study schedule and a rest time?”
- “I can improve grades, but I need sleep or my brain won’t work.”

## Negotiation tips
- bring a clear proposal (schedule, goals, check-ins)
- agree on 1 metric (e.g., weekly progress) not daily arguing

## When to get help
If home feels unsafe, or there’s emotional/physical harm—reach out to a trusted adult, counselor, or local support services.
