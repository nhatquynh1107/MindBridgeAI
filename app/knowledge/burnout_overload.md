# Burnout & Overload

## Signs
- exhausted even after sleep
- irritable, numb, or “I don’t care anymore”
- headaches, stomach issues, frequent sickness
- losing interest in hobbies

## First aid (today)
- reduce commitments for 48 hours where possible
- eat something simple + drink water
- 20-minute walk or stretch (no intense workout needed)
- do only the **top 1–2 tasks** (not everything)

## Reset plan (7 days)
- **Sleep window:** same wake time daily
- **2 study blocks/day** (shorter, focused)
- **one enjoyable activity daily** (even 15 minutes)
- talk to one supportive person

## Boundaries
- “I can’t do extra tasks this week.”
- “I’ll help after Friday.”
- “I need a day to recover.”

## When to get help
If you feel hopeless, can’t get out of bed, or your health is declining—reach out to a trusted adult, counselor, or clinician.
