# Exam Stress & Test Anxiety

## What it can look like
- racing thoughts, blanking out, nausea, shaky hands
- “If I fail, everything is ruined” thinking
- over-studying but not remembering

## Quick reset (2–5 minutes)
1) **Long exhale** (inhale 3, exhale 6) x 10 breaths  
2) Write 2 lines:
   - “What’s the next 20 minutes?”  
   - “What’s one topic I can score easy points on?”

## Study plan that reduces panic
### The 3-layer plan
- **Layer A (must know):** 20–30% topics that appear most often  
- **Layer B (good to know):** medium topics  
- **Layer C (bonus):** hard topics if time remains

### 45-minute cycle
- 25 min active recall (no notes)  
- 10 min check answers + mark gaps  
- 10 min rest / stretch / water

## Active recall ideas
- teach the idea in 5 sentences
- do 3 practice questions
- create 10 flashcards and test yourself

## Exam-day strategy
- First pass: easy questions → secure points  
- If you blank: **pause 10 seconds**, exhale slowly, then write any related keywords.

## Scripts (asking for support)
- To teacher: “I’m studying but I’m getting anxiety and blanking. Can you suggest the most important sections?”
- To friend: “Can we do 30 minutes of practice questions together?”

## When to get help
If anxiety causes frequent panic attacks, vomiting, or you can’t function—talk to a counselor/doctor. You deserve support.
