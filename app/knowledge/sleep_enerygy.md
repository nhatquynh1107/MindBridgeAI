# Sleep, Energy & Phone Habits

## Why sleep matters for teens
Sleep affects:
- memory, learning, mood
- stress tolerance
- focus and motivation

## Quick wins (start tonight)
- fixed wake time (most important)
- sunlight in the morning (5–10 minutes)
- stop caffeine after lunch
- 30-minute wind-down: dim lights, calm music, no heavy studying

## Phone limits that don’t feel impossible
- keep phone outside bed
- set “one last scroll” timer (10 minutes)
- charge phone far from pillow

## If you can’t sleep
- don’t force it; do calm activity (reading, breathing)
- write worries in a “parking list” for tomorrow
- return to bed when sleepy

## When to get help
If insomnia is frequent (weeks) and your daytime functioning drops, talk to a healthcare professional.
