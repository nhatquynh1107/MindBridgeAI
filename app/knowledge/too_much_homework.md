# Too Much Homework (Overload)

## Signs
- you start late because it feels impossible
- constant guilt even when resting
- sleep gets sacrificed every night

## Quick plan (10 minutes)
1) List tasks (no details): 1 line each  
2) Mark each as:
   - **Due soon** / **Important** / **Quick (≤15 min)**  
3) Do **one quick task first** to build momentum.

## Prioritization that actually works
- **Must do today:** due tomorrow OR grading impact OR group depends on you  
- **Can do tomorrow:** due later, low impact  
- **Can ask for help/extension:** too big, unclear, or unrealistic

## “Minimum viable homework”
When overwhelmed, aim for the smallest acceptable version:
- outline instead of full essay
- 5 problems instead of 20 (then ask teacher what matters most)
- draft + submit with note you’ll improve

## Talk to teachers (simple + respectful)
- “I’m trying, but I’m overloaded across subjects. Which parts are essential for learning/grades?”
- “Can I submit a partial version today and the rest tomorrow?”

## Protect sleep (non-negotiable)
If you’re cutting sleep daily, your memory and mood drop.
Choose: **sleep + consistent work** > all-nighter + crash.

## When to get help
If workload is pushing you into chronic insomnia, frequent crying, or thoughts of giving up—tell a trusted adult/counselor.
