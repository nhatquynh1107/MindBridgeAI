# Peer Pressure, FOMO & Boundaries

## What it feels like
- “If I say no, they’ll hate me”
- fear of missing out
- doing things you regret just to fit in

## A boundary is not rude
A boundary is a clear rule for your safety and peace.

## Easy “no” scripts
- “Not today.”
- “I’m not into that.”
- “I have stuff to do—catch you later.”
- “I’m keeping it chill. You do you.”

## If they push
- repeat once, then leave
- change environment (go home, sit with someone safe)
- remember: real friends don’t require you to betray yourself

## Choose your circle
Ask:
- Do I feel safe after hanging out?
- Do they respect my “no”?
- Do I become a worse version of myself?

## When to get help
If you’re pressured into risky behavior (substances, unsafe sex, illegal things), talk to a trusted adult immediately.
