# Quick Coping Toolbox (Fast Relief)

## 1) 60–90 seconds: calm your body
- **Box breathing (4–4–4–4):** inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4 (repeat 4 times).
- **Long exhale:** inhale 3, exhale 6 (repeat 8–10 times).
- **Unclench reset:** relax jaw → drop shoulders → open hands → slow exhale.

## 2) 2 minutes: grounding (when thoughts spin)
- **5–4–3–2–1:** 5 things you see, 4 feel, 3 hear, 2 smell, 1 taste.
- **Name the moment:** “This is stress. It will pass. I’m safe right now.”

## 3) 5 minutes: “tiny win” action
Pick one:
- drink water + wash face
- tidy desk (only 10 items)
- write 3-line plan: *Now / Next / Later*
- open the task and do **just the first step** (no pressure to finish)

## 4) Helpful self-talk (not fake positivity)
- “I don’t need perfect, I need progress.”
- “One small step counts.”
- “Feelings aren’t facts.”
- “I can ask for help and still be capable.”

## When to ask for help
If stress lasts weeks, affects sleep/eating, or you feel hopeless—talk to a trusted adult, school counselor, or health professional.
