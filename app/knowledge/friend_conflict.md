# Friend Conflict & Misunderstandings

## Common triggers
- misread texts / tone
- jealousy, exclusion, rumors
- different expectations (time, loyalty, boundaries)

## Before you reply (30 seconds)
- read the message twice
- breathe slowly once
- ask: “What’s the best outcome I want?”

## Repair conversation (simple structure)
1) **Observation:** “When X happened…”  
2) **Feeling:** “I felt…”  
3) **Need:** “I need…”  
4) **Request:** “Can we…?”

## Scripts
- “I might be misunderstanding—can we talk for 5 minutes?”
- “I felt left out when I wasn’t included. Next time can you tell me?”
- “I care about you, but I’m not okay with jokes about my grades/body.”

## If they don’t respond well
- pause the conversation
- don’t argue in group chats
- talk privately or step back

## When to get help
If conflict turns into bullying, threats, or constant anxiety—tell a trusted adult/school staff.
