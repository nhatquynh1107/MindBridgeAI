# Coding Stress, Debugging Frustration & Impostor Feelings

## What it feels like
- stuck for hours, “I’m dumb”
- comparing to others
- fear of asking questions

## 5-minute reset
- stand up + water
- breathe (inhale 3, exhale 6) x 6
- say: “This is a normal bug. I can isolate it.”

## Debugging checklist (fast)
1) Reproduce the bug consistently  
2) Simplify: smallest input that still fails  
3) Print/log key variables  
4) Check assumptions (types, bounds, nulls)  
5) Search error message (exact text)

## When overwhelmed
Use “one micro-goal”:
- “I will understand the error message”
- “I will write a failing test”
- “I will isolate which function breaks”

## Asking for help (good engineer behavior)
- “Here’s what I tried, here’s output, here’s expected behavior.”
- share minimal reproducible example

## When to step away
If you’re angry or stuck >45 minutes, take a 10-minute break—your brain solves better after reset.
